\begin{frame}{Speed up init}
Emacs now uses a \emph{portable dumper} instead of unexec. This
improves compatibility with memory allocation, and in particular
provides better \emph{Address Space Layout Randomization} (ASLR).\\


  At startup Emacs looks now for a \emph{emacs.pdmp} file and loads
  the dumped state frome there. \\
  
  
  Emacs now loads, very early in the startup process, a
  \emph{early-init.el}. Just befor graphical elements and befor
  package manager is initialized. Installed packages are now activated
  bevor init file is loaded. Therefor calling
  \emph{package-initialize} is no longer necessary. \\

\begin{frame}{Changes at init}
  Emacs now follows XDG convention \\

  \url{https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/} \\

  This will default to \emph{~/.config/emacs} and override traditional
  locations like \emph{~/.emacs.d/} \\
  
  Emacs no longer defaults to using \emph{ImageMagick} to display
  images. This is due to security and stability concerns. \\
